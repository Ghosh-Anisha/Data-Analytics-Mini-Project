# Data-Analytics-Mini-Project

The folders are structured as follows:
1. Attrition analysis.ipynb: The final set of models 
2. EDA & Visualisation.ipynb: The compiled EDA and visualisation, only the important visualisations have been mentioned here
3. Debug Phase 1: The individual EDA files of each team member
4. Debug Phase 2: The individual models for testing and debugging 
5. Datasets: The original dataset(hr_dataset) and the cleaned dataset (final_dataset)

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ghoshanisha/ibm-employee-attrition 

There is no hyperparameter tuning required to run the models(we have done that for you), just change the path to the dataset in both the files 1,2 mentioned above.
